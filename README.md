# SQL challenge
## Part 1
1) INNER JOIN: This join returns rows that match values in both tables. 
If a value is in one table but not the other, those records will not be returned.
2) LEFT JOIN: This join returns all rows from the left table and only the matching rows 
in the right table. If there is no matching row in the right table, a null value will be returned.
3) RIGHT JOIN: This join returns all rows from the right table and only the matching rows 
in the left table. If there is no matching row in the left table, a null value will be returned.
4) FULL JOIN: Returns all rows that match both the left and right tables. 
5) OUTER JOIN: Includes all rows in one table regardless if there are matching rows in the other table.

## Part 2
The final view was created with either a Full Join or a Left Join as seen below: */
